// Ninjas frequently need to signal each other in code, often employing natural sounds as a cover. Weâ€™re going to give our ninja the ability to chirp like a cricket, with the number of chirps encoding different messages.

// Implement a "recursive function" that takes one parameter (n) and outputs a string i.e.

//   chirp(4);
//   //output would be chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.
// javascript/coffescript: don't use the String method .repeat(), write a recursive function, remember you're a Ninja!

//                          solution

function chirp(n) {
    if(n < 2) return 'chirp'
    
    return `chirp-${chirp(n-1)}`
  }
